# trapezoid.js

A port of a Python program I wrote to determine the length of the legs of a trapezoid, given lengths of the two bases and a desired height.

Originally, I used `trapezoid.py` as a CLI to quickly get measurements and basic angles for building a monitor riser during early COVID 2020. It worked really well!

I converted it to JavaScript to see how that would implement inside of a web page, giving a little more reactivity and ease of use for say, checking measurements on a phone while woodworking. 
The third iteration is `trapezoid-react`, which works beautifully as well, despite being a pretty bad usecase for React.
