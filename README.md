# ðŸš€ trapezoid.js

A conversion of a Python program I wrote to determine the length of the legs of a trapezoid, given the two bases and a desired height.

Originally, I used `trapezoid.py` as a CLI to quickly get measurements and basic angles for building a monitor riser.

I converted it to JavaScript to see how that would implement inside of a web page; honestly not sure which method I prefer :). I plan to also create `trapezoid-react`, to see how far it can go ðŸš€.
